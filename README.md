This is my personal corner of the internet! I built this portfolio to showcase my journey as a developer, the projects I've worked on, and the skills I've picked up along the way. It's built with technologies like React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## ✨ Features

-   🌙 **Dark Mode:** Easy on the eyes, especially during those late-night coding sessions.
-   📝 **Dynamic Content:** All the portfolio data lives in a single file, so it's a breeze to update.
-   🤩 **Interactive UI:** I've added some fun touches like a typewriter effect to keep things interesting.
-   🔎 **Project Filtering:** Easily filter through my projects to see what I've been up to.
-   📬 **Contact Form:** Want to say hi? You can send me a message directly from the site.
-   📒 **Blog Section:** My medium blog posts. This is my digital notes section, you will get tech insights in simple language.(new)
-   ✍️ **Editable Current Focus:** Easily update your current focus/status or easily drag-and-drop to reorder them. It uses browsers local storage to store data, meaning your edited data remain unchanged.(new)

## 🛠️ What I Used

-   **React:** For building the user interface.
-   **Vite:** For a super-fast development experience.
-   **Tailwind CSS:** To make it look pretty without writing a ton of CSS.
-   **React Router:** To handle navigation between pages.
-   **Radix UI:** For accessible and unstyled UI components.
-   **Lucide React:** For the beautiful and consistent icons.

## 💻 Getting Started

Want to run this project locally? Here's how:

    Now you can open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see it in action!
    
## 🚀 Deployment
